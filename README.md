# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, primarily caused by damage to the retinal blood vessels due to prolonged high blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. Early detection of DR is crucial in preventing severe vision loss. However, manual diagnosis from retinal fundus images is a complex and challenging task due to the intricate nature of the images, overlapping features, and varying stages of disease severity. This study proposes a robust and efficient solution for DR detection using deep learning techniques, specifically through a hybrid ensemble model. The proposed model combines four state-of-the-art architectures: EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet, and InceptionV3. These models are integrated using a voting classifier to exploit their individual strengths—EfficientNet’s scalability, ResNet’s depth handling, DenseNet’s feature reuse, and InceptionV3’s multi-scale feature extraction. The ensemble approach enhances both accuracy and robustness, making it highly suitable for real-world DR screening applications. This method aims to offer a more accurate, automated, and scalable solution for DR detection, improving early diagnosis and contributing to better management of the disease.
